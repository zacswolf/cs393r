For the following questions, the parameters of your car are as follows:
● Length: l
● Width: w
● Wheel base: b
● Track width: d
● Obstacle safety margin: m

define dl = (l-b)/2
define dw = (w-d)/2

Assume that the distance from the rear axle to the rear end of the car is the 
same as the distance from the front axle of the car to the front end of the car. 
The car is symmetric laterally. Observations are made in the base_link frame of 
the car, which is coincident with the center of the rear axle of the car. 
The car is turning along an arc of radius r, and observes a point p=(x,y).

1. Which point of the car traces an arc of maximum radius? What is that radius, 
in terms of r and other car parameters?

Outer front
r_max = r_of = ((r+w/2)^2 + (l- dl)^2)^.5 


2. Which point of the car traces an arc of minimum radius? What is that radius, 
in terms of r and other car parameters?

Inner back
r_min = r_ib = ((r-w/2)^2 + (-dl)^2)^.5 


Note radius of inner front
r_if = ((r-w/2)^2 + (l-dl)^2)^.5 

Radius of outer back
r_ob = ((r+w/2)^2 + (-dl)^2)^0.5

Radius of p from steering center
r_p = ((r-y)^2 + (x)^2)^.5 

3. Under what conditions will p first hit the inner side (the side closer to the 
center of turning) of the car as the car drives forward?

    It will hit the inner side if p is inside the arc traced by the inner-front 
    corner of the car and outside the arc traced by the inner-rear corner of the car.
    
    r_ib <= r_p <= r_if


4. Under what conditions will p first hit the front of the car as the car drives 
forward?

    It will hit the front side if p is outside the arc traced by the inner-front 
    corner of the car and inside the arc traced by the outer-front corner of the car.
    
    r_if <= r_p <= r_of



5. Under what conditions will p first hit the outer side (the side farther to 
the center of turning) of the car as the car drives forward?

    It will hit the outer side if p won't hit the inner side and front side as well as 
    if p is outside the arc traced by the inner-back corner of the car and inside the 
    arc traced by the outer-back corner of the car.
    r_ib <= r_p <= r_ob and not going to hit the front or inner-side

6. What is the maximum distance (the free path length) the car can move forward 
along the arc before it hits the point p?

Note that r is non-negative

if point will hit front side:
let z = 1 when we turn left and z = -1 we when turn right


let c be the point where the car collides with p, relative to the car.
c = (l-dl, q)

Find q:
    r_p^2 = (r-z*q)^2 + (l-dl)^2
    (r-zq)^2 = r_p^2 - (l-dl)^2
    r-zq = (r_p^2 - (l-dl)^2)^(1/2)
    q = z(r - (r_p^2 - (l-dl)^2)^(1/2))

Now define c and p relative to the center of the curve that we are driving on
c' = c - (0, z*r) = (l-dl, q) - (0, z*r) = (l-dl, q-z*r)
p' = p - (0, z*r) = (x, y) - (0, z*r) = (x, y-z*r)

Now find angle between c' and p':
    cos(theta) = (<c',p'>)/(norm(c') * norm(p'))
    theta = acos((<c',p'>)/(norm(c') * norm(p'))) # check return value of acos, should be [0, PI]

Now find free path length:
    fpl = 2PIr * theta/2PI = r * theta


else if point will hit inner side: 
let z = 1 when we turn left and z = -1 we when turn right

let c be the point where the car collides with p, relative to the car.
c = (q, z*w/2) 
Find q:
    r_p^2 = q^2 + (r - w/2)^2
    q^2 = r_p^2 - (r - w/2)^2
    q = (r_p^2 - (r - w/2)^2)^(1/2)

Now define c and p relative to the center of the curve that we are driving on
c' = c - (0, z*r) = (q, z*w/2) - (0, z*r) = (q, z*w/2 -z*r) = (q, z(w/2 - r))
p' = p - (0, z*r) = (x, y) - (0, z*r) = (x, y-z*r)

Now find angle between c' and p':
    cos(theta) = (<c',p'>)/(norm(c') * norm(p'))
    theta = acos((<c',p'>)/(norm(c') * norm(p'))) # check return value of acos, should be [0, PI]

Now find free path length:
    fpl = 2PIr * theta/2PI = r * theta


else if point will hit outer side: 
let z = 1 when we turn left and z = -1 we when turn right

let c be the point where the car collides with p, relative to the car.
c = (q, -z*w/2) 
Find q:
    r_p^2 = q^2 + (r + w/2)^2
    q^2 = r_p^2 - (r + w/2)^2
    q = (r_p^2 - (r + w/2)^2)^(1/2)

Now define c and p relative to the center of the curve that we are driving on
c' = c - (0, z*r) = (q, -z*w/2) - (0, z*r) = (q, -z*w/2 -z*r) = (q, -z(w/2 + r))
p' = p - (0, z*r) = (x, y) - (0, z*r) = (x, y-z*r)

Now find angle between c' and p':
    cos(theta) = (<c',p'>)/(norm(c') * norm(p'))
    theta = acos((<c',p'>)/(norm(c') * norm(p'))) # check return value of acos, should be [0, PI]

Now find free path length:
    fpl = 2PIr * theta/2PI = r * theta




7. If the current velocity of the car is v, and the maximum magnitude of 
deceleration is a, what is the minimum stopping distance of the car? 
[This will determine which curvature options should be ruled out, 
depending on their free path lengths]

    stopping_distance = (v^2)/(2*a)
